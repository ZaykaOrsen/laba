Operation Barbarossa was the invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany and many of its Axis allies, starting on Sunday, 22 June 1941, during the Second World War. 
It was the largest land offensive in human history, with around 10 million combatants taking part.

The theme of Barbarossa had long been used by the Nazis as part of their political imagery, though this was really a 
continuation of the glorification of the famous Crusader king by German nationalists since the 19th century. 
According to a Germanic medieval legend, revived in the 19th century by the nationalistic tropes of German Romanticism, 
the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa—who drowned in Asia Minor while leading the Third Crusade—is not dead but asleep 
along with his knights in a cave in the Kyffhäuser mountains in Thuringia and is going to awaken in the hour of Germany's 
greatest need and restore the nation to its former glory.[35] Originally, the invasion of the Soviet Union was codenamed 
Operation Otto (alluding to Holy Roman Emperor Otto the Great's expansive campaigns in Eastern Europe),
[36] but Hitler had the name changed to Operation Barbarossa in December 1940.[37] Hitler had in July 1937 praised Barbarossa as 
the emperor who first expressed Germanic cultural ideas and carried them to the outside world through his imperial mission.[38] 
For Hitler, the name Barbarossa signified his belief that the conquest of the Soviet Union would usher in the Nazi "Thousand-Year 
Reich".[38]
